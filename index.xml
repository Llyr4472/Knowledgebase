    <guid>https://knowledgebase.prashantgiri360.com.np/Networking/Port</guid>
    <description>A port is a numeric identifier within each segment that is used to keep track of specific conversations between a client and server. Ports are assigned and managed by an organization known as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).</description>

    <guid>https://knowledgebase.prashantgiri360.com.np/Networking/Socket</guid>
    <description>The combination of the source IP address and source Port number, or the destination IP address and destination Port number is known as a socket. Sockets enable multiple processes, running on a client, to distinguish themselves from each other, and multiple connections to a server process to be distinguished from each other.</description>

    <title>TCP IP Model</title>
    <link>https://knowledgebase.prashantgiri360.com.np/Networking/TCP-IP-Model</link>
    <guid>https://knowledgebase.prashantgiri360.com.np/Networking/TCP-IP-Model</guid>
    <description>TCP/IP protocol is responsible for guaranteeing reliable delivery of a packet. TCP/IP protocol has 4 layers: Application Layer Represents data to the user, encoding and dialog control Transport Layer Supports communication between various devices across network Internet Layer Determines best path through the network Network Access Layer Controls the devices and media that make up the network The difference between TCP IP Model and OSI Model are given in TCP IP vs OSI Model.</description>

    <guid>https://knowledgebase.prashantgiri360.com.np/Networking/TCP-IP-vs-OSI-Model</guid>
    <description>While TCP/IP and OSI both are meant to standardize communication in a network, they have some key similarities and differences. TCP/IP model does not describe general functions that are necessary for all networking communications.</description>

    <guid>https://knowledgebase.prashantgiri360.com.np/Networking/TCP</guid>
    <description>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a Transport Layer Protocol that is widely used to ensure reliable and ordered delivery of data over a network. Unlike UDP, TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that establishes a connection between the sender and receiver before data transmission.</description>

    <guid>https://knowledgebase.prashantgiri360.com.np/Networking/Transport-Layer-Protocol</guid>
    <description>Transport Layer is the 4th Layer of OSI Model and 3rd Layer of TCP IP Model. It is responsible for ensuring packets are sent reliably and any missing packets are resent.</description>
