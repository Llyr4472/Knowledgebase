    <description>The combination of the source IP address and source Port number, or the destination IP address and destination Port number is known as a socket. Sockets enable multiple processes, running on a client, to distinguish themselves from each other, and multiple connections to a server process to be distinguished from each other.</description>

    <guid>https://knowledgebase.prashantgiri360.com.np/Networking/TCP-IP-Model</guid>
    <description>TCP/IP protocol is responsible for guaranteeing reliable delivery of a packet. TCP/IP protocol has 4 layers: Application Layer Represents data to the user, encoding and dialog control Transport Layer Supports communication between various devices across network Internet Layer Determines best path through the network Network Access Layer Controls the devices and media that make up the network The difference between TCP IP Model and OSI Model are given in TCP IP vs OSI Model.</description>

    <description>While TCP/IP and OSI both are meant to standardize communication in a network, they have some key similarities and differences. TCP/IP model does not describe general functions that are necessary for all networking communications.</description>
